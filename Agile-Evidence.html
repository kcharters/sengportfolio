        <h1>Agile Evidence</h1>
        <h2> Working through being agile</h2>    
        <p>
During the first sprint I learnt more about the github workflow and how it can help teams collaborate together better by use of kanban 
(previously I have used trello to work in a group which is kind of similar but I didnt really know the extent of how this worked properly)
In our kanban we had 4 columns <br>
          <ul>
        <li> Todo where we place our issues or user stories that are to be worked on</li>
<li> In Progess where we place our issues that we are currently working on and are assigned to members </li>
<li> Review when the issue is complete but needs to be looked at or checked preferably by the client </li>
<li> Done when the issue has been completed </li>
            </ul>

        <h3> Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential</h3>
<p>
Using the make:auth tutorial really cemented the idea of using the framework to work for you. 
Instead of having to manually code everything it was done with a simple comand line. This freed my time to work on more for the sprint 
and help my team with anything they were having problems with.
</p>

<p>
I learnt about branching, which was a new concept for me. 
We made a developer branch off our main master branch (the main master branch is where the code for the deployed site is) this helped keep any major bugs away from the main deployment code. 
Then from this developer branch we created our own seperate branches titled for what we working on and would be merged back to 
the developer branch when completed. This also helped me visually understand merge conflics as opposed to dealing with merge conflicts on 
a command line. After looking at all our branches we probably made far too many, I myself kept making new branches for all the things i was doing <br>

<h3> Delivering working software frequently </h3>
  <p>
Deploying our site to the server and being able to show the client when our sprint was finished.
 Also showing the client on not just a computer or laptop but on a phone as well to present responiveness and functionailty.
  Deployment also ment the client had easier access to the application instead of showing locally during meetings. 
</p>
<p>
In the beginning our team was not the best at scrums especially after we lost a team member and were only a three person we would generally
 just get together and work on the project but using sprint management we could easily delegate issues and discuss who could do what 
  within the timeframe (using a point system on our issues).</p><br>

        <h3> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective</h3>
 Using sprint retropectives we went through and checked that we had completed the objectives that were established at the beginning of the sprint, what we did well and what could be improved. 
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/QM03h62/sprint-retrospective.png" alt="sprint-retrospective" border="0">
        This transpired into creating more issues and users stories from talking with the client and putting them into the next sprint.
  <h3> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</h3>
We agreed the final sprint would be dedicated to code clean up and making sure the final product was what the client was happy with. 
Most of our communication was via teams messages this sprint as one memeber was quite ill which meant we couldnt have our usual scrum meetings however they asked to be scrum master next sprint to make up for this. 
      <br> 
  Even though the last sprint this was a half sprint the I did a lot work technically. I also learnt more about how github works, reviewing code and being able to leave
  messages or comments with the review changes button. Ive really learnt a lot about the git hub workflow and would use in a much better manner than I have 
  during this semester as their are still lots of small bits that Im learning about github, and think its an amazing workflow to use.

  In our last meeting with the client he originally told us not to do anything too technical as we wouldnt have much time,
  however the next day he sent an email with a list tasks he would like to have completed. Most were UX design related but a few were technical 
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/HgpXX3R/Hymie-Email.jpg" alt="Hymie-Email" border="0"> <br>
  Our team was able to implement a majority of these things before final presentation day. 
  <h3>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</h3>
  While we wanted to focus on code clean up our client changed their mind and gave us a list of technical issues they wanted implemented.
  I authorised the edit buttons buy adding a foreign key to our tables and adding a relationship between the models. Whitle the others worked on 
  UX designn and some technical issues of their own. It was quite a rush to complete everything but we managed to complete mostly everything.
  
     <h3>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</h3>
      This half sprint was about tidy up of the application, with one memeber not communicating about images and taking a bit longer with it. 
      I came up with a quick data entry work around so we had some images to display for our presentation which i let the team know about, but 
      seemed to have upset the memeber working on image upload as they had not shown up to class and had not messaged us on teams, and they had gotten it finally working.
