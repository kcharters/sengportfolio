  <h3> Agile Manifesto and principles </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
          <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
          <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
          </li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
      </ul>
  <p> What the agile manifesto and its 12 principles took the whole semester for me to full grasp of what this methodology meant. I had never
    experienced this or how project mamangement worked. To me, at the end of this semester , it meant that it is more how you work, weither 
    its the collaborators or client. The values of human communication and feedback, adapting to change, and producing working results are important.
  <h3> Scrum FrameWork</h3>
My team did not implement this framework as best it could, especially with stand up meetings, but with research, I have gained an understanding to implement it better in the future.

         <h3>Laravel Framework</h3>
         Frameworks for development are a fantastic way to develop an application. Previously I had not used these before and this was
         my first introduction to frameworks and MVC (model, view ,controller). It really sparked my passion to get more into web development,
         and I asked someone I knew in the industry already who used ASP.NET (c# mvc framework) working in design patterns and structures and
         reviewing other companies custom built websites in mvc. <br>
