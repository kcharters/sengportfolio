Sprint One

Professional:
During sprint one our group was not the greatest at stand up meetings however we did meet at the same time every week for our two full meetings, it was difficult to organise everyone having the same free time but out communication via teams was alway constant

Because I was the only one to meet the client on the day we first showed them our user stories I became the main point of email contact with the client to meet with him.

Technical:
For sprint one I took the task to create to create the login as i thought it would be a challenge until i realised the it was a simple command and i followed the laravel docs for this.
During this sprint a team memeber made changes to the "Todo tutorial" to coiencide with our game naming conventions but didnt quite do it
right, which ended up with the site only working for them and not the rest of the group leaving us all confused.
So i took the initiave, and re-did the tutorial and changed it to our naming conventions and getting it working 
for everyone. This really helped me in understanding what was going on in the back end of the site.

Agile:
"Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential"
Use the make:Auth tutorial really cemented the idea of using the framework to work for you. instead of having to manually code everything 
it was done with a simple line.

Personal Reflection:
What behaviour will i change next sprint: 
no doubting my ability, originally i felt overwhelemd at the idea of this project but ive found my strengths from this.
What mistakes did i make:
My team members left me by myself a couple of times, which i didnt really know what to do in the beginning but during the sprint i learnt to how to be a bit more assertive and find my role.

(need to add pictures and styling to this)
