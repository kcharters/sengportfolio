# Personal Reflection

## Sprint 1

### What did i do well:
I became the main contact with our client and regularily set up meetings and keeping the team informed of these meetings. Standup scrum meetings and also team meetings once a week when we had technical problems. Using our team wiki when forgetting how to do certain things and also adding my own knowledge to it. [wiki](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-raidarea51/wiki)
### What mistakes did i make: 
Not doubting my ability, originally i felt overwhelemd at the idea of this project but ive found my strengths from this.<br>
Relying on a team leader, even in the workforce, I have become used to not being a leader and letting people tell me what i need to do and just doing it. 
### Barriers: 
My team members left me by myself a couple of times, which i didnt really know what to do in the beginning but during the sprint however i learnt to how to be a bit more assertive and find my role.
### Lessons learned
Not to rely on others and leanring to take initiative which is a role im not used to 
Im very passive but I learned how to be a bit more assertive in a group dynamic and mediate between others.
I also learnt about frameworks and how web design in industry is done which has compeled me to try other frameworks such as ASP.net and Django in the summer break as this is something i would like to do when i complete the degree 
<br>
## Sprint 2
### What did i do well: 
I used my previous knowledge to implement styling , fixed some issues that other members were having especially with our naming conventions and getting our controller functions to work with the database, which helped me understand the back end of what was going on with the site.

### What mistakes did i make:
With only having three members due to losing one memeber and another having family commitments I became quite resentful towards my team and need to be more understanding that somethings cant be controlled
Trying to take on others work as well as my own made me prioritise the project over other things I had to do which wasnt a good idea in the long run considering the workload i myself have this also relates to the agile principle "Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely." 
### Barriers:
some team members not contributing as much the others and adding and changing of issues with the client, im lucky i can adapt to change even it makes me uncomfortable and anxious this is a personailty trait of my own that i have had to 
overcome on a day to day basis and taught me how to be more agile.

### Lessons learned
The dynamics of team work and working around it. Being less resentful of group work, from previous experience i didnt like working in a group because some memebers arent always as commited or want to finish things as early as i like to 
and ive learnt to accept and adapt to it 
<br>
## Sprint 3
### What did i do well:<br>
While whaat i did was not as technically challegning as before i used my knowledge from my web programming class to help my other members with what they were working on to complete the spring. 
### What mistakes did i make:<br>
Learning what and how to be more agile and that it relates to more than just use a kanban board to deligate work with team members. 
<br>
My knowledge in eloquent wasnt what i thought it was which cause some mistakes in the code i wrote and needed to be changed. I realised i didnt fully understand what it means to be agile and suggested that we look through our code to make it more accessible to others especially the visually impared. 
<br>
### Barriers:<br>
<br>
### Lessons learned <br>
I learned that i am what could be coined as an 'accidental leader'. With my knowledge of laravel gained from my web programming class i spent most of the sprint show my team how to do things a simplier way than what they found on the internet. Im no normally a leader and am pretty passive. This taught me how to communicate my own knowledge in a way to teach another person.
