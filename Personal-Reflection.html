<h1> Personal Reflection</h1>

<h2> Sprint 1</h2>

<h3> What did I do well:</h3>
I became the main contact with our client and regularily set up meetings and keeping the team informed of these meetings.
 Standup scrum meetings and also team meetings once a week when we had technical problems. Using our team wiki when forgetting
  how to do certain things and also adding my own knowledge to it.<br>
   <a href="https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-raidarea51/wiki">Wiki Link</a>
<h3> What mistakes did i make: </h3>
Not doubting my ability, originally I felt overwhelemd at the idea of this project but Ive found my strengths from this.<br>
Relying on a team leader, even in the workforce, I have become used to not being a leader and letting people tell me what i
 need to do and just doing it. 
<h3> Barriers: </h3>
My team members left me by myself a couple of times, which I didnt really know what to do in the beginning but during the
 sprint however I learnt to how to be a bit more assertive and find my role.
<h3> Lessons learned</h3>
Not to rely on others and leanring to take initiative which is a role im not used to. 
Im very passive but I learned how to be a bit more assertive in a group dynamic and mediate between others.
I also learnt about frameworks and how web design in industry is done, which has compeled me to try other frameworks
 such as ASP.net and Django in the summer break as this is something I would like to do when I complete the degree. 
<br>
<h2> Sprint 2</h2>
<h3> What did i do well: </h3>
I used my previous knowledge to implement styling , fixed some issues that other members were having especially with our
 naming conventions and getting our controller functions to work with the database, which helped me understand the back end 
 of what was going on with the site.

<h3> What mistakes did i make:</h3>
With only having three members due to losing one memeber and another having family commitments I became quite resentful 
towards my team and need to be more understanding that somethings cant be controlled.
Trying to take on others work as well as my own made me prioritise the project over other things I had to do which wasnt 
a good idea in the long run considering the workload I myself have, this also relates to the agile principle "Agile processes 
promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely." 
<h3> Barriers:</h3>
Some team members not contributing as much the others and adding and changing of issues with the client, Im lucky I can 
adapt to change even if it makes me uncomfortable and anxious. This is a personailty trait of my own that I have had to 
overcome on a daily basis.

<h3> Lessons learned</h3>
The dynamics of team work and working around it. Being less resentful of group work, from previous experience I didnt 
like working in a group because some memebers arent always as commited or dont want to finish things as early as I like to 
and Ive learnt to accept and adapt to it.
<br>
<h2> Sprint 3</h2>
<h3> What did i do well:</h3>
While what i did was not as technically challegning as before I used my knowledge from my web programming
 class to help my other members with what they were working on to complete the sprint. 
<h3> What mistakes did i make:</h3>
Learning what and how to be more agile and that it relates to more than just use a kanban board to deligate work with team members. 
Being agile is a mindset and will take a while master.
<br>
My knowledge in eloquent wasnt what I thought it was which caused some mistakes in the code I wrote and needed to be changed. 
<h3> Barriers:</h3>
 Translating my own knowledge so that others can understand and explaining code and what its doing. When helping with the search function I found it hard to translate my own knowledge to what someone else can understand.
<br>
<h3> Lessons learned </h3>
I learned that I am what could be coined as an 'accidental leader'. With my knowledge of laravel gained from my web programming class
 I spent most of the sprint showing my team how to do things a simplier way than what they found on the internet. 
 Im not normally a leader and am pretty passive. This taught me how to communicate my own knowledge in a way to teach another person. 
<br>
        <h2>Sprint 4</h2>
        <h3> What did i do well:</h3>
        Expanding my knowledge on something I had already done. During the first sprint I had used a simple line of code to create the authentication.
        This sprint I took it further with how the authentication can check a if a user has logged in and what is avaliable to those not logged in or per user.
        <h3> What mistakes did i make:</h3>
        I did all my work the day before meeting with client which is not optmial or agile. My time management and prioritsation got out of hand
        during this sprint with other class work luckily I had previous knowledge on how to implement editing so i could do it quickly
        <h3> Barriers:</h3>
        Some miscommuniation at the end of sprint. A team memeber was having trouble with uploading images and I suggested a work around 
        if it couldnt be done in time for final presentation which was taken the wrong way ,that i was trying to take over their work, but 
        after a bit of explanation and a face to face conversation it was resolved. 
        <h3> Lessons learned </h3>
        Time management is important as is proper communication. I cant always rely on what I already know when completing tasks and this mistake 
        could have left me and my team in an awful position when meeting with the client. 
        <h2>Sprint 5</h2>
        <h3> What did i do well:</h3>
        I got a lot of technical completed this sprint, adapting to the sudden change of what the client wanted last minute let me implement some features im quite proud of 
        <h3> What mistakes did i make:</h3>
        Being a three person team one memeber and myself became a bit weary of anothers changes to our site but were afraid of confrontation
        with the memeber as their had been misunderstandings before. And not pulling them up on bad git usage (using gt add *) which caused a break in deployment,
        bringing back the cursed capital I to our index page from the beginning of the project.
        <h3> Barriers:</h3>
        This sprint is where our group really fell apart. Members were adding code without telling the rest of the team what it was for. 
        <h3> Lessons learned </h3>
        This sprint their was a lot of hindsight in what I would have done differently in the project. I think Ive really grasped the idea of how
        MVC (Model View Controller) works and frameworks are a great way to create web applications. Looking back on when we first began 
        and how overwhelemed I felt with all these new methodologies and technology I feel much more comfortable now and am proud of the work
        my group and I did together. <br>
