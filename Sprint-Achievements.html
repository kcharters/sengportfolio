<h1> Sprint Achievements</h1>

<h2> Sprint One</h2>

<h3> Professional:</h3>
During sprint one our group was not the greatest at stand up meetings however we did meet at the same time every week 
for our two full meetings, it was difficult to organise everyone having the same free time but out communication via teams was alway constant. 

Because I was the only one to meet the client on the day we first showed them our user stories I became the main point of
 email contact with the client to meet with him.

We also created a group <a href="https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-raidarea51/wiki">Wiki Page</a> to look back on to remember file 
locations, common procedures, commands etc

<h3> Technical:</h3>
For sprint one I took the task to create to create the login as I thought it would be a challenge until i realised the it was 
a simple command `php artisan make:auth` and I followed the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/authentication">Laravel Docs Authentication</a> for this.
During this sprint a team memeber made changes to the "Todo tutorial" to coiencide with our game naming conventions but didnt quite do it
right, which ended up with the site only working for them and not the rest of the group leaving us all confused.
So i took the initiave, and re-did the <a href="https://morioh.com/p/9b8c8ef67bd5/laravel-5-8-tutorial-from-scratch-for-beginners">tutorial here</a>
and changed it to our naming conventions and getting it working 
for everyone. by using ctl+f to find all the todo variables and changing them to our gamesvariable. This really helped me in understanding
 what was going on in the back end of the site.

<h2> Sprint 2 </h2>
<h3> Professional:</h3>
This sprint I learnt moreabout git usage and adding single files rather than * to add all as i had previously done in Professional practice.
 I also learnt about github and branching so we werent working on the master banch, making pull requests and collaboratin with my team when
  a merge conflict arised and making meaningful commits <br>

  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/5F1zj1S/meaningful-commits.jpg" alt="meaningful-commits" border="0"><br>
Communication with the team via team chat working together daily keeping everyone updated on changes or errors and helping each other 
especially myself when i needed step by step on how to merge branches.

<h3>Technical </h3>
Our group was having trouble with the games view working with the database so I took initiave again rather than leaving my team
 members to struggle and looked at our games controller versus the tutorial controller and when through the CRUD storefunction to
  make sure what was on our database matched what was with our controller (this was before i learnt about CRUD in my web programming class)

  <br>
We had some issues with deployment when one of our pages would work and this is how i learnt that linux is case sensitive, which 
is what our deployed site is hosted on, versus windows not begin case sensitive when we look at our site locally. 
I also did the main styling  and use a CC0 (creative commons free use) image as our logo
<h2> Sprint 3</h2>
<h3> Professional</h3>
Learning Laravel side by side with software engineering class and web 2 programming helped me help my team. 
One team member was having trouble with creating a search function and was using a tutorial that required downloaded packages, 
which we figured out meant we would all have to download the same packages and also download them on the deployment site to get working.
 So I made a quick search function with an easier tutorial, that i had origially suggested to the team, and with my knowledge of forms from 
 my web class helped the other memember create a simplier, working search function for the site.

<h3> Technical</h3>
Also from learning about eloquent in my web class i changed the view scores to be our actual leaderboard and sorted it
 by score using eloquent, eloquent is similar to making select quiries in sql but with different syntax. 
 Orginally I thought i would have to join tables but seeing as our add scores is basically data entry i managed to sort 
 it and i implemented this in the top ten splash screen on the home page. I had some confusion with this as 
 it didnt seem to be sorting by the higest number until i realised our databse was set score to string and so it 
 was sorting alphbetically. I managed to change our table to integer to get the sort numerically using this <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/migrations#updating-columns">doc</a> page.
Most of my technical achievements this sprint was helping the other memebers in my team.

<h2>Sprint 4</h2>
        <h3> Professional</h3>
        Most of our meetings and communication were held through our teams chat as one of our memebrs was quite ill during this sprint which meant we didnt have scrum meetings like we 
        normally do. 
        My git bash usage has improved exponentially, I feel much more confortable using it now then I did in the beginning, I can make sense of the errors a lot easier. 
        <h3>Technical</h3>
        During sprint 3 I hadnt completed anything too technically for myself, and as Im learning most of what we need in web2 programming it
        was hard to what would be technically chanllenging for myself. I delved more into authentication and how to make our site more
        secure from people who werent logged in or resgistered. Their were two options for this, using middlware on the routes or checking the 
        authentication with an if statement as shown below.<br>
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/48ksNrT/using-if-statement.png" alt="using-if-statement" border="0">
        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/jZ2d4Zp/using-middlwareauth.png" alt="using-middlwareauth" border="0">
        <br>
        I decided to go with checking authentication on the navigation bar, as it looked a lot better than using middleware as this caused the login form to displayed on every route.
        I also implement some CRUD (Create Replace Update Delete) because currently our site was just pure data entry. So I suggested the user be able to edit their mistakes, this was don through
        the edit and update functions in the games and scores controllers. I used a couple of tutorials and my previuos knowledge of implementing it for another assignment.
        Compiling all the routes under <code> Route::resource('/games','GamesController);</code>and <code>Route::resource('scores','ScoresController);</code>
        This is great for CRUD and keeping routes tidy.
