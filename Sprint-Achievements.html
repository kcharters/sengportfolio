<h1> Sprint Achievements</h1>

<h2> Sprint One</h2>

<h3> Professional:</h3>
During sprint one our group was not the greatest at stand up meetings however we did meet at the same time every week 
for our two full meetings, it was difficult to organise everyone having the same free time but out communication via teams was alway constant. 

Because I was the only one to meet the client on the day we first showed them our user stories I became the main point of
 email contact with the client to meet with him.

We also created a group <a href="https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-raidarea51/wiki">Wiki Page</a> to look back on to remember file 
locations, common procedures, commands etc

<h3> Technical:</h3>
For sprint one I took the task to create to create the login as I thought it would be a challenge until i realised the it was 
a simple command `php artisan make:auth` and I followed the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/authentication">Laravel Docs Authentication</a> for this.
During this sprint a team memeber made changes to the "Todo tutorial" to coiencide with our game naming conventions but didnt quite do it
right, which ended up with the site only working for them and not the rest of the group leaving us all confused.
So i took the initiave, and re-did the <a href="https://morioh.com/p/9b8c8ef67bd5/laravel-5-8-tutorial-from-scratch-for-beginners">tutorial here</a>
and changed it to our naming conventions and getting it working 
for everyone. by using ctl+f to find all the todo variables and changing them to our gamesvariable. This really helped me in understanding
 what was going on in the back end of the site.

<h2> Sprint 2 </h2>
<h3> Professional:</h3>
This sprint I learnt moreabout git usage and adding single files rather than * to add all as i had previously done in proessional practice.
 I also learnt about github and branching so we werent working on the master banch, making pull requests and collaboratin with my team when
  a merge conflict arised and making meaningful commits <br>

Communication with the team via team chat working together daily keeping everyone updated on changes or errors and helping each other 
especially myself when i needed step by step on how to merge branches.

<h3>Technical </h3>
Our group was having trouble with the games view working with the database so I took initiave again rather than leaving my team
 members to struggle and looked at our games controller versus the tutorial controller and when through the CRUD storefunction to
  make sure what was on our database matched what was with our controller (this was before i learnt about CRUD in my web programming class)

  <br>
We had some issues with deployment when one of our pages would work and this is how i learnt that linux is case sensitive, which 
is what our deployed site is hosted on, versus windows not begin case sensitive when we look at our site locally. 
I also did the main styling  and use a CC0 (creative commons free use) image as our logo
<h2> Sprint 3</h2>
<h3> Professional</h3>
Learning Laravel side by side with software engineering class and web 2 programming helped me help my team. 
One team member was having trouble with creating a search function and was using a tutorial that required downloaded packages, 
which we figured out meant we would all have to download the same packages and also download them on the deployment site to get working.
 So I made a quick search function with an easier tutorial, that i had origially suggested to the team, and with my knowledge of forms from 
 my web class helped the other memember create a simplier, working search function for the site.

<h3> Technical</h3>
Also from learning about eloquent in my web class i changed the view scores to be our actual leaderboard and sorted it
 by score using eloquent, eloquent is similar to making select quiries in sql but with different syntax. 
 Orginally I thought i would have to join tables but seeing as our add scores is basically data entry i managed to sort 
 it and i implemented this in the top ten splash screen on the home page. 
Most of my technical achievements this sprint was helping the other memebers in my team.
