## Sprint 1

### Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential

Using the make:auth tutorial really cemented the idea of using the framework to work for you. 
Instead of having to manually code everything it was done with a simple line. This freed my time to work on more for the sprint and help my team with anything they were having problems with.

## Sprint 2

### Delivering working software frequently 
Deploying our site to the server and being able to show the client when our sprint was finished. Also showing the client on not just a computer or laptop but on a phone as well to present responiveness and functionailty 

## Sprint 3
### At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective
In the beginning our team was not the best at scrums especially after we lost a team member and were only a three person we would generally just get together and work on the project but using sprint management we could easily delegate issues and discuss who could do what within the timeframe (using a point system on our issues).
