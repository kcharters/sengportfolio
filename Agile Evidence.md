# Agile Evidence
## Sprint 1
During the first sprint I learnt more about the github workflow and how it can help teams collaborate together better by use of kanban (previously i have used trello to work in a group which is kind of similar but I didnt really know the extent of how this worked properly)
In our kanban we had 4 columns 
- Todo where we place our issues or user stories that are to be worked on
- In Progess where we place our issues that we are currently working on and are assigned to members 
- Review when the issue is complete but needs to be looked at or checked preferably by the client 
- Done when the issue has been completed

however in this stage of the sprint i hadnt fully grasped the idea of branching until sprint 2

### Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential

Using the make:auth tutorial really cemented the idea of using the framework to work for you. 
Instead of having to manually code everything it was done with a simple line. This freed my time to work on more for the sprint and help my team with anything they were having problems with.


## Sprint 2
This sprint i learnt about branching, which was a new concept for me. We made a developer branch off our main master branch (the main master branch is where the code for the deployed site is). then from this developer branch we created our own seperate branches titled for what we working on and would be merged back to the developer branch when completed. This also helped me visually understand merge conflics as opposed to dealing with merge conflicts on a command line. <br>

### Delivering working software frequently 
  
Deploying our site to the server and being able to show the client when our sprint was finished. Also showing the client on not just a computer or laptop but on a phone as well to present responiveness and functionailty. Deployment also ment the client had easier access to the application instead of showing locally during meetings. 

## Sprint 3

### At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective

In the beginning our team was not the best at scrums especially after we lost a team member and were only a three person we would generally just get together and work on the project but using sprint management we could easily delegate issues and discuss who could do what within the timeframe (using a point system on our issues). Discussing how we can make our site more suitable for the visually impared which ment cleaning up code.

## Sprint 4
### Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- with team i noticed we had no crud, questions i proposed were what if a user makes a mistake, the mistake is stuck there 
- suggested i implement as i didnt do anything technically challenging last sprint
