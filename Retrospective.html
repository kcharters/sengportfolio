        I really enjoyed working with my team and think we worked really well together. The team was really supportive of each other and the client was pleasant to work with as well. 
        Professionally I would have pushed my team to do more scrums and implement the scrum framework more into our project. Technically their are a lot of things code wise I would have changed and wish we could have made. 
        Im really proud of team for being one of the top three projects that the client liked.

  <h2> Agile Manifesto and principles </h2>
        <ul> 
          <li> Focus on people over process</li>
           <li>Embed customers and their feedback in order to continuously improve</li>
           <li> Work in small segments in order to get wuick feedback</li>
           <li> Experiment and learn continuously </li>
        </ul>
        "88% of over 2,000 respondents representing 91 countries and 27 industries reported agile—and the scrum methodology specifically—improves quality of life. " - Tracey Brower, Forbes.com.<br>
  <p> What the agile manifesto and its 12 principles took the whole semester for me to kind of grasp of what this methodology meant. I had never
    experienced this or how project mamangement worked. To me, at the end of this semester , it meant that it is more how you work, weither 
    its the collaborators or client. The values of human communication and feedback, adapting to change, and producing working results are important.
  <h3> Scrum FrameWork</h3>
My team did not implement this framework as best it could, especially with stand up meetings, but with research, I have gained an understanding to implement it better in the future.

         <h3>Laravel Framework</h3>
         Frameworks for development are a fantastic way to develop an application. Previously I had not used these before and this was
         my first introduction to frameworks and MVC (model, view ,controller). It really sparked my passion to get more into web development,
         and I asked someone I knew in the industry already who used ASP.NET (c# mvc framework) working in design patterns and structures and
         reviewing other companies custom built websites in mvc. <br>
