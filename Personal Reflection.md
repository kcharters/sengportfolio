# Personal Reflection

## Sprint 1
What behaviour will i change next sprint: no doubting my ability, originally i felt overwhelemd at the idea of this project but ive found
my strengths from this.<br>
What mistakes did i make: My team members left me by myself a couple of times, which i didnt really know what to do in the beginning but during the sprint i learnt to how to be a bit more assertive and find my role.
Barriers <br>
Lessons learned <br>
