# Personal Reflection

## Sprint 1
What behaviour will i change next sprint: ,br>
not doubting my ability, originally i felt overwhelemd at the idea of this project but ive found my strengths from this.<br>
What mistakes did i make: relying on a team leader within the team 
Barriers: <br>
My team members left me by myself a couple of times, which i didnt really know what to do in the beginning but during the sprint i learnt to how to be a bit more assertive and find my role.
Lessons learned <br>
Not to rely on others and leanring to take initiative which is a role im not used to 
Im very passive but I learned how to be a bit more assertive in a group dynamic 
<br>
## Sprint 2
What behaviour will i change next sprint: <br>
With only having three members due to losing one memeber and another having family commitments I became quite resentful towards my team and need to be more understanding that somethings cant be controlled
<br>
What mistakes did i make:<br>
Trying to take on others work as well as my own made me prioritise the project over other things I had to do which wasnt a good idea in the long run considering the workload i myself have 
<br>
Barriers:<br>
some team members not contributing as much the others and adding and changing of issues with the client, im lucky i can adapt to change even it makes me uncomfortable and anxious this is a personailty trait of my own that i have had to 
overcome on a day to day basis
<br>
Lessons learned <br>
The dynamics of team work and working around it. Being less resentful of group work, from previous experience i didnt like working in a group because some memebers arent always as commited or want to finish things as early as i like to 
and ive learnt to accept and adapt to it
