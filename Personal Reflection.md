# Personal Reflection

## Sprint 1
### What behaviour will i change next sprint:
not doubting my ability, originally i felt overwhelemd at the idea of this project but ive found my strengths from this.<br>
What mistakes did i make: relying on a team leader within the team 
### Barriers: 
My team members left me by myself a couple of times, which i didnt really know what to do in the beginning but during the sprint i learnt to how to be a bit more assertive and find my role.
## Lessons learned
Not to rely on others and leanring to take initiative which is a role im not used to 
Im very passive but I learned how to be a bit more assertive in a group dynamic 
I also learnt about frameworks and how web design in industry is done which has compeled me to try other frameworks such as ASP.net and Django in the summer break as this is something i would like to do when i complete the degree 
<br>
## Sprint 2
### What behaviour will i change next sprint: 
With only having three members due to losing one memeber and another having family commitments I became quite resentful towards my team and need to be more understanding that somethings cant be controlled

### What mistakes did i make:
Trying to take on others work as well as my own made me prioritise the project over other things I had to do which wasnt a good idea in the long run considering the workload i myself have 

### Barriers:
some team members not contributing as much the others and adding and changing of issues with the client, im lucky i can adapt to change even it makes me uncomfortable and anxious this is a personailty trait of my own that i have had to 
overcome on a day to day basis

### Lessons learned
The dynamics of team work and working around it. Being less resentful of group work, from previous experience i didnt like working in a group because some memebers arent always as commited or want to finish things as early as i like to 
and ive learnt to accept and adapt to it
