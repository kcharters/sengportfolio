# Sprint Achievements

## Sprint One

### Professional:
During sprint one our group was not the greatest at stand up meetings however we did meet at the same time every week for our two full meetings, it was difficult to organise everyone having the same free time but out communication via teams was alway constant

Because I was the only one to meet the client on the day we first showed them our user stories I became the main point of email contact with the client to meet with him.

### Technical:
For sprint one I took the task to create to create the login as i thought it would be a challenge until i realised the it was a simple command and i followed the laravel docs for this.
During this sprint a team memeber made changes to the "Todo tutorial" to coiencide with our game naming conventions but didnt quite do it
right, which ended up with the site only working for them and not the rest of the group leaving us all confused.
So i took the initiave, and re-did the tutorial and changed it to our naming conventions and getting it working 
for everyone. This really helped me in understanding what was going on in the back end of the site.

## Sprint 2 
### Professional:
github usage making meaningful commits communication with the team via team chat working together daily keeping everyone updated on changes or errors, continuing our weekly meetings, learning branching and using it well 

### Technical 
getting the view games to work with the database a team memeber created reading the gamesController php file and learning about the CRUD (before learning about it in my web programming class) regarding the store function and what we had in the database deployment and learning how linux is case sensitive whereas windows is not styling a css
